"""POST /internal/chat/uploads/ingest — workspace-side chat upload sink.

Replaces the Docker-exec / tar-copy path the platform-side workspace-server
used historically (see RFC #2312). The platform forwards the multipart
request to this handler with a Bearer header carrying the workspace's
inbound secret; this handler validates, writes each file under
``/workspace/.molecule/chat-uploads/<random>-<sanitized-name>``, and
returns the same ``ChatUploadedFile`` shape the platform Go handler
returned previously, so callers (canvas, molecli, A2A tools) see no
contract change.

Why no platform-side Docker-exec equivalent here:
    The handler runs INSIDE the workspace container, which already has
    direct filesystem access to /workspace. mkdir + open + write is
    enough — no archive ceremony, no remote-exec round-trip, no
    docker socket dependency. The same code path runs on local Docker and
    managed workspaces; the bug behind #2308 (the platform provisioner had no
    container handle) cannot exist here by construction.

Path safety:
    sanitize_filename strips everything outside [A-Za-z0-9._-], collapses
    spaces, refuses ``""``/`"."`/`".."`, and caps length at 100 chars
    (preserving extension if ≤16 chars). Files are written with
    O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW so a pre-existing symlink at the target
    cannot redirect the write to /etc/* or any sensitive location, and
    a colliding name fails fast (the random prefix already makes
    collisions astronomical, but defense-in-depth costs nothing).

Limits (matches the Go contract from chat_files.go):
    - 100 MB total request body
    - 100 MB per file
    - filename truncated to 100 chars

Response shape:
    {"files": [
        {"uri": "workspace:/workspace/.molecule/chat-uploads/<id>-<name>",
         "name": "<sanitized name>",
         "mimeType": "<content-type or guessed>",
         "size": <bytes>}
