"""Build a JSON-RPC handler that returns ``-32603 "agent not configured"``.

Used by the workspace runtime when ``adapter.setup()`` fails (most often
because an LLM credential is missing or rotated). Lets ``/.well-known/agent-card.json``
keep serving 200 — the workspace stays REACHABLE for canvas/operator
introspection — while message-send requests get a clear, immediate
error instead of silently timing out.

Kept as its own module so the behavior is unit-testable without booting
the whole runtime (main.py is ``# pragma: no cover``).

    """Return a Starlette POST handler that always 503s with JSON-RPC -32603.

    ``reason`` is surfaced in the JSON-RPC ``error.data`` field so canvas
    can render "agent not configured: <reason>" to the user. Pass the
    stringified ``adapter.setup()`` exception. ``None`` falls back to a
    generic "adapter.setup() failed".

    Secret redaction (issue molecule-core#2760): ``reason`` is run
    through ``secret_redactor.redact_secrets`` once, when the handler
    is built. If a future adapter author writes ``raise
    RuntimeError(f"auth failed for {token}")``, the token is replaced
    with ``<redacted-secret>`` BEFORE it lands in the response —
    closes the structural leak path PR #2756 introduced. Per-request
    hot path stays unchanged (one cached string, no re-redaction).

    The handler echoes the request's JSON-RPC ``id`` when present so a
    well-behaved JSON-RPC client can correlate the error to its request.
    Malformed bodies (non-JSON, missing id) get ``id: null`` per spec.
