"""Boot smoke mode — exercises the executor's full import tree without touching real platforms.

Why this exists (issue #2275): the existing `wheel_smoke.py` only IMPORTS
`molecule_runtime.main` at module scope. Lazy imports buried inside
`async def execute(...)` bodies (e.g. `from a2a.types import FilePart`)
NEVER evaluate at static-import time — they crash at first message
delivery in production.

The 2026-04-2x v0→v1 a2a-sdk migration shipped 5 such regressions in
templates that all looked fine at module-load smoke. This module fills
the gap by actually invoking `executor.execute(stub_ctx, stub_queue)`
once with a short timeout. If the import-tree is healthy the call
proceeds far enough to hit a network boundary (LLM call, etc.) and
times out — that's a *pass*. If a lazy import is broken, the call
raises `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError` from inside the executor
body — that's a *fail*.

Universal wedge gate (task #131): timeout-as-pass alone misses init
wedges where the SDK process spins for 60s+ on a malformed argv
(claude-agent-sdk PR #25 class). After every result path, the smoke
consults `runtime_wedge.is_wedged()` — adapters opt-in by calling
`runtime_wedge.mark_wedged(reason)` from their executor's wedge catch
arm, and the smoke upgrades the provisional PASS to FAIL when the
flag is set. Non-opt-in adapters keep working as before — the check
is additive.

Activated by setting `MOLECULE_SMOKE_MODE=1` in the env. Wired into
`main.py` after `executor = await adapter.create_executor(...)` so the
full adapter setup path runs first; the smoke just adds one more
exercise step before exit.

CI usage (intended for `molecule-ci/.github/workflows/publish-template-image.yml`):
  docker run --rm \
    -e WORKSPACE_ID=fake -e MOLECULE_SMOKE_MODE=1 \
    -e MOLECULE_SMOKE_TIMEOUT_SECS=90 \
    "$IMAGE" molecule-runtime
The 90s timeout is calibrated to claude-agent-sdk's 60s
`initialize()` handshake — adapters with shorter init can lower it.

    Universal turn-smoke (task #131): adapters that hit an unrecoverable
    init wedge (e.g. claude-agent-sdk's `Control request timeout:
    initialize` after a malformed CLI argv) call
    `runtime_wedge.mark_wedged(reason)`. The smoke gate consults this
    flag at the end of every result path — pre-existing PASS branches
    are upgraded to FAIL when the flag is set, so a wedge that was
    triggered inside a still-running execute() (timeout branch) or
    inside a non-import exception (PASS-on-other-error branch) gets
    surfaced instead of silently shipping a broken image to GHCR.

    Lazy import: the runtime may be installed without runtime_wedge in
    a corrupt-rolling-deploy state, in which case "no wedge info"
    reads as "assume healthy" — same fail-open posture heartbeat.py
    takes for the same reason.

    Catch is narrowed to import errors only — a signature change
    (`is_wedged` removed/renamed, `wedge_reason` returning the wrong
    type) must NOT silently degrade to "no wedge info." The runtime's
    structural snapshot test (workspace/tests/test_runtime_wedge_signature.py,
    task #169) carries the API-drift load: any rename surfaces there
    as a snapshot mismatch instead of letting the smoke gate go blind.
