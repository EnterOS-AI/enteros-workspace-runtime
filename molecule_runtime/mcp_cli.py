"""Console-script entry point for the ``molecule-mcp`` universal MCP server.

Validates required environment BEFORE importing the heavy
``a2a_mcp_server`` module — that module triggers a ``RuntimeError`` at
import time when ``WORKSPACE_ID`` is unset (a2a_client.py:22), and
console-script entry-point shims surface it as an ugly traceback. This
wrapper catches the missing-env case early and prints actionable help
to stderr so an operator running ``molecule-mcp`` for the first time
gets the right pointer in the first 3 lines of output instead of a
20-line traceback.

Standalone-runtime contract: this wrapper is responsible for keeping
the workspace ALIVE on the platform side, not just exposing tools.
Concretely it:
    1. Calls ``POST /registry/register`` once at startup (idempotent —
       the upsert flips status awaiting_agent → online for an external
       workspace whose token matches).
    2. Spawns a daemon heartbeat thread that POSTs to
       ``POST /registry/heartbeat`` every 20s. Without continuous
       heartbeats the platform's healthsweep flips the workspace back
       to awaiting_agent (visible as OFFLINE in the canvas with a
       "Restart" CTA) within 60-90s.
    3. Runs the MCP stdio loop in the foreground.

Why threads + sync requests: the MCP stdio server is async. The
heartbeat work is fire-and-forget HTTP. A daemon thread is the
lowest-friction integration — no asyncio bridging, dies automatically
when the main process exits, and ``requests`` is already a transitive
dependency via ``a2a-sdk``.

In-container usage (``python -m molecule_runtime.a2a_mcp_server`` or
direct import) bypasses this wrapper — the workspace runtime has its
own heartbeat loop in ``heartbeat.py`` so we don't double-heartbeat.

Module layout (RFC #2873 iter 3 split):
    * ``mcp_heartbeat`` — register POST + heartbeat loop + auth-failure
      escalation + inbound-secret persistence.
    * ``mcp_workspace_resolver`` — env validation, single + multi-workspace
      resolution, operator-help printer, on-disk token-file read.
    * ``mcp_inbox_pollers`` — activate the inbox singleton + spawn one
      daemon poller per workspace.

This file keeps just ``main()`` plus thin re-exports of the private
symbols so existing tests' imports (``mcp_cli._build_agent_card``,
``mcp_cli._heartbeat_loop``, etc.) keep working without churn.
