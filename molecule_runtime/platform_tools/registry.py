"""Canonical registry of platform tool specs.

Every tool the platform offers to agents (A2A delegation, persistent
memory, broadcast, introspection) is defined ONCE in TOOLS below.
Adapters consume these specs to register the tool in their native
runtime format:

  - a2a_mcp_server.py iterates `TOOLS` to build the MCP TOOLS list +
    dispatches calls to spec.impl. No tool name or description is
    hardcoded there.

  - builtin_tools/{delegation,memory}.py define LangChain `@tool`
    wrappers using `name=` from the spec; the wrapper body just
    calls spec.impl.

  - executor_helpers.get_a2a_instructions(mcp=True) /
    get_hma_instructions() GENERATE the system-prompt doc string from
    `TOOLS` — no hand-maintained instruction text for MCP-capable
    runtimes.

  - executor_helpers._A2A_INSTRUCTIONS_CLI is a SEPARATE hand-maintained
    block for CLI subprocess runtimes (ollama and any other adapter
    that drives a2a via `python3 -m molecule_runtime.a2a_cli ...`). It
    uses different command-shape names than the registry tool names
    (e.g. `peers` vs `list_peers`), so it cannot be auto-generated
    from JSON-schema specs without losing the readable invocation
    syntax. Its tool-coverage alignment with the registry is enforced
    by the `_CLI_A2A_COMMAND_KEYWORDS` mapping in executor_helpers.py
    and the alignment tests in test_platform_tools.py — adding a new
    a2a tool here will fail those tests until the mapping is updated.

Adding a new tool: append a ToolSpec to `TOOLS` below, then update
`_CLI_A2A_COMMAND_KEYWORDS` in executor_helpers.py (set the value to
the CLI subcommand keyword, or to `None` if the tool isn't exposed via
the CLI subprocess interface). The structural alignment tests in
workspace/tests/test_platform_tools.py fail otherwise.

Renaming a tool: change `name` here. Search workspace/ for the old
literal in case any non-adapter consumer (tests, plugin code) hard-coded
it; update those manually. The grep is the audit, the test is the gate.

Removing a tool: delete the entry AND its `_CLI_A2A_COMMAND_KEYWORDS`
key. Adapters stop registering it automatically; doc generators stop
mentioning it.
