"""Delegation tool handlers — single-concern slice of the a2a_tools surface.

Extracted from ``a2a_tools.py`` (RFC #2873 iter 4b). Owns the three
delegation MCP tools + the RFC #2829 PR-5 sync-via-polling helper they
share.

Public surface:

* ``tool_delegate_task`` — synchronous delegation, waits for response.
* ``tool_delegate_task_async`` — fire-and-forget delegation; returns
  ``{delegation_id, ...}``.
* ``tool_check_task_status`` — poll the platform's ``/delegations`` log.

Internal:

* ``_delegate_sync_via_polling`` — durable async + poll for terminal
  status (RFC #2829 PR-5 cutover path; toggled by
  ``DELEGATION_SYNC_VIA_INBOX=1``).
* ``_SYNC_POLL_INTERVAL_S`` / ``_SYNC_POLL_BUDGET_S`` constants.

Circular-import note: this module calls ``report_activity`` from
``a2a_tools`` to emit activity rows around the delegate dispatch.
``a2a_tools`` imports the public symbols here at module-load time,
so we use a LAZY import for ``report_activity`` inside the function
that needs it. Without the lazy hop Python raises an ImportError
on first ``a2a_tools`` import.

    Sidesteps the platform proxy's blocking `message/send` HTTP path that

      1. POST /workspaces/<src>/delegate (async, returns 202 + delegation_id)
         — platform's executeDelegation goroutine handles A2A dispatch in
         the background. No client-side timeout dependency on the platform
         holding a connection open.
      2. Poll GET /workspaces/<src>/delegations every 3s for a row with
         matching delegation_id reaching terminal status (completed/failed).
      3. Return the response_preview text on completed; surface error_detail
         on failed (with the same _A2A_ERROR_PREFIX wrapping the legacy
         path uses, so caller error-detection logic is unchanged).

    Both /delegate and /delegations are existing endpoints — this helper
    just composes them into a polling synchronous facade. The result is

    no extra latency vs. the legacy proxy-blocked path on fast cases.
