"""Heartbeat + register thread for the standalone ``molecule-mcp`` wrapper.

Extracted from ``mcp_cli.py`` (RFC #2873 iter 3) so the heartbeat /
register concern lives in its own module. The console-script entry
``mcp_cli:main`` still drives the spawn, but the loop body, auth-failure
escalation, and inbound-secret persistence now live here so they can be
read, tested, and replaced independently of the orchestrator.

Public surface:

* ``HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` — cadence constant.
* ``build_agent_card(workspace_id)`` — payload helper.
* ``platform_register(platform_url, workspace_id, token)`` — one-shot
  POST /registry/register at startup.
* ``start_heartbeat_thread(platform_url, workspace_id, token)`` — spawn
  the daemon thread.

    Lifts the workspace from ``awaiting_agent`` to ``online`` for
    operators who never ran the curl-register snippet. Safe to call
    repeatedly: the platform's register handler is an upsert that
    just refreshes ``url``, ``agent_card``, and ``status``.

    Failure model (post-review):
        - 401 / 403  → ``sys.exit(3)`` immediately. The operator's
          token is wrong; silently looping in a broken state would
          make this hard to diagnose because the MCP tools would 401
          on every call too. Hard-fail is the kindest option.
        - Other 4xx/5xx → log a warning + continue. The heartbeat
          thread will surface persistent failures; transient platform
          blips shouldn't abort the MCP loop.
        - Network / transport errors → log + continue. Same reasoning.
