"""Memory tool handlers — single-concern slice of the a2a_tools surface.

Extracted from ``a2a_tools.py`` (RFC #2873 iter 4c). Owns the two
agent-memory MCP tools:

  * ``tool_commit_memory`` — write to the workspace's persistent memory.
  * ``tool_recall_memory`` — search the workspace's persistent memory.

Both go through the platform's ``/workspaces/:id/memories`` endpoint;
the platform is the source of truth for namespace isolation + audit
trail. Local responsibility here is RBAC enforcement BEFORE hitting
the network so a denied operation surfaces a clear in-band error
instead of an opaque platform 403.

Imports the RBAC primitives from ``a2a_tools_rbac`` (iter 4a).
