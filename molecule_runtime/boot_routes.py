"""Build the Starlette routes for a workspace from its (card, adapter
state) pair.

Pairs with PR #2756, which decoupled ``/.well-known/agent-card.json`` from
``adapter.setup()`` failure. main.py was the only consumer and was
``# pragma: no cover`` — so the wiring (card-route mounted unconditionally,
JSON-RPC route swapped between DefaultRequestHandler and the
not-configured handler based on ``adapter_ready``) had no pytest coverage.

A future refactor that re-couples the two would silently bypass PR #2756
and shipped the original "stuck booting forever" UX again. That gap is
what closes here: extract the route-assembly into a pure function whose
behaviour is unit-testable with Starlette's TestClient, and have main.py
call it. Issue molecule-core#2761.

    JSON-RPC route at ``/`` swaps based on adapter state:

      executor (production happy-path).
    * ``executor`` is None → ``not_configured_handler`` returning JSON-RPC

      redeploy with corrected env) instead of crash-looping invisibly.

    The two branches are mutually exclusive — caller passes one or the

    pins the contract.
