"""Messaging tool handlers — single-concern slice of the a2a_tools surface.

Extracted from ``a2a_tools.py`` (RFC #2873 iter 4d). Owns the four
human-and-peer messaging MCP tools + the chat-upload helper they share:

  * ``tool_send_message_to_user`` — push a canvas-chat message via the
    platform's ``/notify`` endpoint.
  * ``tool_list_peers`` — discover peers across one or many registered
    workspaces, with side-effect of populating ``_peer_to_source`` for
    delegate-task auto-routing.
  * ``tool_get_workspace_info`` — JSON-encode the workspace's own info.
  * ``tool_chat_history`` — fetch prior conversation rows with a peer.
  * ``_upload_chat_files`` — internal helper for the message-attachments
    code path; routes local file paths through the platform's
    ``/chat/uploads`` so the canvas can render them as download chips.

Imports the auth-header primitive from ``a2a_tools_rbac`` (iter 4a).
