    Why this exists (#2484): the inbox poller's notification callback
    in molecule-mcp called the synchronous ``enrich_peer_metadata`` on
    every push, blocking the poller for up to 2s × N uncached peers
    per batch. Push-delivery latency was gated on registry latency —
    the exact thing the negative-cache patch in PR #2471 was supposed
    to avoid amplifying. Moving the fetch off the poller thread means
    push delivery is bounded by the inbox poll interval, never by
    registry RTT.

    Trade-off: the FIRST push from a new peer arrives metadata-light
    (no name/role). The MCP host renders the bare peer_id. Subsequent
    pushes (within the 5-min TTL) hit the warm cache and get the full
    record. Acceptable because:
      - Channel-envelope enrichment is a UX nicety, not a correctness
        invariant.
