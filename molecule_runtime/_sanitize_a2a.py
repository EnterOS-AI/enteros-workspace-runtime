"""OFFSEC-003: A2A peer-result sanitization — shared across delegation tools.

This module is intentionally a LEAF (no imports from the molecule-runtime
package) to avoid circular dependency cycles. Both ``a2a_tools_delegation``
and ``a2a_tools`` can import from here without creating import loops.

Trust-boundary design (OFFSEC-003):
    A2A peer responses are untrusted third-party content. Before passing
    them to the agent context, they MUST be wrapped in a trust-boundary
    marker pair so the calling agent knows the content is external.

Boundary markers:
    - _A2A_BOUNDARY_START = "[A2A_RESULT_FROM_PEER]"
    - _A2A_BOUNDARY_END   = "[/A2A_RESULT_FROM_PEER]"

The boundary is the PRIMARY security control. A peer that sends
"[A2A_RESULT_FROM_PEER]evil[/A2A_RESULT_FROM_PEER]safe" can make "safe"
appear inside the trusted context unless the markers themselves are
escaped before wrapping — see _escape_boundary_markers() below.

Defense-in-depth (secondary):
    Known prompt-injection control-words are also escaped so that even
    if a calling agent ignores the boundary marker, embedded attack
    patterns (SYSTEM:, OVERRIDE:, etc.) lose their special meaning.
    This is not a complete injection sanitizer — do not rely on it as
    the primary control.
