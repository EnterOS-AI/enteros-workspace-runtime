"""In-memory inbox + background poller for the standalone molecule-mcp path.

Purpose
-------
The universal MCP server (a2a_mcp_server.py) is OUTBOUND-ONLY by default —
it gives an MCP-aware agent the same A2A delegation, peer-discovery, and
memory tools that container-bound runtimes already have. There is no
inbound delivery path: when the canvas user types a message or a peer
sends an A2A request, the activity lands on the platform but the
standalone agent never sees it.

This module closes that gap WITHOUT requiring a tunnel or a public agent
URL. A daemon thread polls ``/workspaces/:id/activity?type=a2a_receive``
on the platform and stages new rows in an in-memory deque. Three new MCP
tools (``inbox_peek``, ``inbox_pop``, ``wait_for_message``) let the
agent observe the queue.

Why a poller (not push)
-----------------------
runtime=external workspaces have ``delivery_mode="poll"`` — the platform
records inbound A2A in ``activity_logs`` but does not call back to the
agent. A poller is the only inbound surface that works without the
operator exposing a public URL through a tunnel. 5s cadence matches
the molecule-mcp-claude-channel plugin's POLL_INTERVAL — it's already
proven on staging for the channel-based delivery path.

Cursor model
------------
``activity_logs.id`` is the cursor (server-assigned, monotonic). We
persist it to ``${CONFIGS_DIR}/.mcp_inbox_cursor`` so an agent restart
doesn't replay the last 10 minutes of inbound traffic and re-act on
already-handled messages. On 410 (cursor pruned) we drop back to
``since_secs=600`` for a bounded backlog and let the cursor advance
naturally from there.

Scope
-----
Standalone molecule-mcp ONLY. The in-container runtime has its own
push delivery (main.py + canvas WebSocket); we never want both
running at once or a single message would be delivered twice. The
caller (mcp_cli.main) gates activation explicitly via
``activate(state)``; in-container code that imports this module by
accident gets a no-op until activate is called.

    crash tracebacks.

    the daemon thread doesn't outlive the test that started it and race
    with later tests' httpx patches. Production code passes None and
