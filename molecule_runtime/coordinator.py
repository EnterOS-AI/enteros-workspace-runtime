"""Coordinator pattern for team workspaces.

When a workspace is expanded into a team, the parent agent becomes a
coordinator that routes incoming tasks to the appropriate child workspace
based on the task content and children's capabilities.

The coordinator:
1. Fetches its children's Agent Cards (skills, capabilities)
2. Analyzes each incoming task to determine which child is best suited
3. Delegates to the chosen child via the delegation tool
4. Aggregates responses if a task requires multiple children
5. Falls back to handling the task itself if no child is appropriate
