"""Inbox tool handlers — single-concern slice of the a2a_tools surface.

Standalone-runtime path for inbound-message delivery (push-mode runtimes
get messages via the channel-tag synthesis in a2a_mcp_server). The
``InboxState`` singleton is set by ``mcp_cli`` before the MCP server
starts; in-container runtimes never call ``inbox.activate(...)`` so
``inbox.get_state()`` returns None and these tools surface an
informational error instead of raising.

When-to-use guidance for agents (mirrored in
``platform_tools/registry.py``):
  - ``wait_for_message``: block until a new inbound message arrives, then
    decide what to do with it; forms the loop ``wait → respond → wait``.
  - ``inbox_peek``: inspect the queue non-destructively.
  - ``inbox_pop``: remove a handled message by activity_id.

Extracted from ``a2a_tools.py`` in RFC #2873 iter 4e so the kitchen-sink
module shrinks to a back-compat shim. The extraction also makes the
``_enrich_inbound_for_agent`` helper unit-testable in isolation —
previously it was buried in ``a2a_tools`` and only exercised through
the inbox wrappers, leaving its peer-id-empty / cache-miss / registry-
unavailable branches under-covered.

    miss the helper returns the bare message; the next call within the
