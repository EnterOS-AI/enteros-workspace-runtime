"""SSOT gate — platform_agent_identity literals MUST match the canonical
mcp-plugin-delivery contract.

This is the check that would have caught the RCA#2970 concierge-online bug:
``mcp_server_present()`` looked for a path/name that had drifted from how the
management MCP is actually delivered (plugin -> settings.json), so a healthy
concierge self-reported false and the server gate refused to mark it online.

Scope (honest): this is the RUNTIME-LOCAL gate. It pins this repo's literals to
this repo's vendored copy of ``contracts/mcp-plugin-delivery.contract.json`` —
so an in-repo edit that changes a literal without the contract (or vice versa)
fails ``unit-tests`` before any image ships. The CROSS-REPO guarantee that the
core/template/runtime copies stay byte-identical is enforced separately by the
``mcp-plugin-delivery-contract-drift`` workflow in molecule-core; wiring this
repo's copy into that byte-compare set is a tracked follow-up.
